    "## Project Summary & Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis of Ola's ride-sharing data has revealed several key insights that can help guide business strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Peak Demand is Concentrated on Weekdays**: The busiest days for bookings are consistently **Monday and Tuesday**, with demand gradually decreasing towards the weekend. This suggests that the primary use case for the service is work-week commuting rather than leisure travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vehicle Popularity is Evenly Distributed**: There is no single dominant vehicle type. **Prime Sedans, eBikes, Autos, and others** are all booked in very similar numbers. This indicates a diverse customer base with varied needs and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A Significant Portion of Bookings Fail**: While a majority of rides are successful, a large number of bookings are lost. **Driver-initiated cancellations** are the largest source of failed bookings, followed by \"Driver Not Found\" errors. This represents a major area for potential revenue recovery and customer satisfaction improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Top Customers Drive High Value**: A small group of \"power users\" contributes significantly to the platform. Identifying and retaining these top customers through loyalty programs could be a valuable strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Python Functions (`app.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streamlit application was built using several key Python functions to ensure performance and interactivity:\n",
    "* `create_db_engine()`: This function establishes the connection to the MySQL database. It is cached so that the connection is only made once per session, improving performance.\n",
    "* `load_data()`: This function runs a `SELECT *` query to fetch the entire dataset from the MySQL table. The results are cached so that the large dataset is only loaded into memory once.\n",
    "* **Sidebar and Main Page Logic**: The app uses `st.sidebar` to create interactive filters for date range, vehicle type, and booking status. The main page uses `st.session_state` to enable a dynamic, button-based navigation system, allowing users to switch between different analysis views without a linear page flow. All charts and KPIs are built with the **Plotly** library and are regenerated whenever a filter is changed to reflect the new data subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of 10 SQL queries were executed in MySQL Workbench to extract specific, targeted insights from the clean database. These queries were used to:\n",
    "* **Analyze Booking Status**: Calculate the count and total value of successful bookings, as well as the number of cancellations by customers and drivers.\n",
    "* **Analyze Customer and Driver Behavior**: Identify the top 5 customers by ride volume, retrieve rides based on payment method (UPI), and find the min/max ratings for specific vehicle types.\n",
    "* **Analyze Vehicle Performance**: Calculate the average ride distance and customer rating for each vehicle category to compare their performance.\n"
